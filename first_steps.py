# Exercise 2 - First steps with Python (3)
# Answers to questions that ask for non-code answers can simply be added as comments.

# 1) The following line causes a SyntaxError. Please correct the line so that it's output is 'Hallo Welt!' [1P]
print(Hallo Welt!)

# 2) Calculate the difference between a and b and assign the result to a variable called 'v_1'. What are the datatypes of a, b and 'v_1'? [2P]
a = 976.543
b = 345

# 3) Calculate the remainder of the division 100/17 by only using one operator and save the result in v_2 (maybe google helps?) [1P]

# 4) The speed of light is about 300'000 km/s. What is the wavelength (in nanometers) of a light wave with a frequency of 5.0E+14 per second? Can we see this light? [4P]
#    If you don't know how to convert frequencies to wavelengths, google can help you!
#    Save the result in v_3.

# 5) Print the following string to the console using the format-function and the variables 'n' and 'pi': "Pi rounded to the first 10 decimals is: 3.1415926536" [2P]
n  = 10
pi = 3.14159265358979323846264338
